**********************************************
To run the MainCode.py first install the following modules

import sys
import os
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cv2
from scipy.stats import multivariate_normal

Now place a video 'test.mp4' in the same directory as this code and run the code.

One can reduce the scaling factor based on how much resolution one needs in the output video.
Reducing the scaling factor reduces the resolution but increases the speed of the code significantly.
